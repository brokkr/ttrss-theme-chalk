ttrss-theme-chalk 
================= 

A fork of asyncopation's chalk theme for my personal use.
* Bigger, nicer (IMO) font - ["Source Sans Pro"]
  (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) instead of Arial/helvetica
* Discards a lot of options (mass selection and manipulation) and information
 for a cleaner look
* Less finicky CSS (fewer absolute placements, line heights and absolute font
  sizes)

---------------------

** For Legacy Versions **

Sometimes the TT-RSS maintainer makes changes that break theme compatability.  Use the following tags if you're still using an old version of ttrss.

* ttrss version 1.8-1.11 use tag "ttrss-v1.8"
* ttrss version 1.12-1.15.2 use tag "ttrss-v1.12"

---------------------

A simplistic theme for the tt-rss reader based off of the work by [levito](https://github.com/levito/tt-rss-feedly-theme). 

Prerequisites

* ttrss version 1.8 or higher
